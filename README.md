Problems we ran into:
  - The main issue we had was a bug that caused both the edited and unedited versions of the live feed to continuously overlap each other, creating an unattractive flickering effect
  - Other problems we ran into mostly pertained to the detail-oriented design of this project. Constantly updating thresholds and value ranges to display UI objects cleanly and allow for meaningful visual changes without making the stream unwatchable
